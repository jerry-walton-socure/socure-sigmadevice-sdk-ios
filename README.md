# Sigma Device iOS SDK

The Sigma Device iOS SDK provides a framework for adding device fingerprinting into your native iOS applications.

## Minimum requirements

-   iOS 12 and above
-   Xcode 11.4+

## Installation

You can install the Sigma Device iOS SDK using CocoaPods or by manually downloading and installing it. We recommend that you use CocoaPods.

NOTE: You must be logged into github.com to download the SDK.

To install the SDK using CocoaPods, add the following lines to your Podfile:

```
use_frameworks!

# Pods for Sigma Device

pod 'DeviceRisk', :git => 'socure-inc/socure-sigmadevice-sdk-ios.git'
```

After this, you'll need to import the SDK into your desired View Controller by calling `import DeviceRisk` at the top of your View Controller.

## Configuration and usage

The Sigma Device iOS SDK's main class is `DeviceRiskManager`. You can initialize a local instance of `DeviceRiskManager` via `public init()` or you can use a global, shared instance by calling `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance`.

### Configure the `DeviceRiskManager` Class

The SDK uses the following functions to collect device data and send it to Socure:

-  [setTracker()](#settracker)
-  [sendData()](#senddata)

### setTracker()

The `setTracker()` function configures the SDK and specifies the types of device data to collect and track.

To call `setTracker()`:

```
DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.setTracker(key:String, sources:[DeviceRiskDataSources], existingUUID:String, userConsent:Bool)
```

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`          | The public SDK key for your account.                                                                                                                           |
| `sources`      | An array of `DeviceRiskDataSources` that identifies the types of device data to collect.                                                                       |
| `existingUUID` | The `deviceSessionId` calculated by the DeviceRisk SDK at a previous instance. Allows historical data for a device to be linked to a single unique identifier. |
| `userConsent`  | Indicates if the consumer has provided consent. If set to `false`, the SDK will not collect any device information.                                            |

#### DeviceRiskDataSources

Sigma Device depends on the following types of data to gauge the authenticity of a device:

| Data Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Device-centric data | Data tied to information about linguistic, cultural, and technological conventions used to format data for presentation, such as calendar type and keyboard language. |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Accessibility       | Active accessibility settings.                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Network             | WiFi connection information. Enable the Access WiFi Information service for your App ID and include it in `Entitlements.plist` to access the information.             | To request WiFi data, your app must activate the `Access WiFi Information` capability. This is an additional capability you can add via the “Signing and Capabilities” section of your Project Target.  |
| Location            | Location and regional data.                                                                                                                                           | To use location data, add the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key to `Info.plist`.                                                                                                                |
| Device motion       | Device motion data, such as acceleration and gyroscope.                                                                                                               | To use device motion data (includes accelerometer, gyroscope, and device motion support), configure the `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities` key in `Info.plist` with the accelerometer and gyroscope values. |
| Advertising ID      | Apple-issued ID that identifies a device to advertisers.                                                                                                              | To use advertising information, add the `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` key to `Info.plist`.                                                                                                           |
| Pedometer           | Pedometer data such as number of steps taken and floors climbed.                                                                                                      | To use pedometer data, add the `NSMotionUsageDescription` key to `Info.plist`.                                                                                                                          |

While there may be circumstances in which not all data types are available, we encourage you to gather as much data as possible. The data type `location` is strongly recommended. We also recommend, at a minimum:

-   `device`
-   `locale`
-   `accessibility`
-   `network`

The optimal list of data types are as follows:

```
case device
case accelerometer
case motion
case magnetometer
case locale
case location
case advertising
case pedometer
case network
case accessibility
case context
```

For example, to track all services, call `setTracker()` as follows:

```
`DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.setTracker(key: "<SOCURE_Public_Key>", sources: [.device, .network, .accessibility, .locale, .advertising, .accelerometer,.magnetometer,.motion, .pedometer, .location, .external])`
```

**Caution**: Apple requires that all apps published through the App Store implement the following keys in `Info.plist`:

```
`NSMotionUsageDescription`
`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
```

Note that while these services will not be called by Sigma Device unless specified in `setTracker`, Apple's review process will flag these key values as required in `Info.plist`. If not included, Apple will either inform you of the missing keys, or remove the uploaded build before it's approved.

### sendData()

The `sendData()` function collects the device data, sends it to Socure’s servers, and returns a `deviceSessionId`.

To call `sendData()`:

```
DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context:Context)
```

**Note**: To retrieve an existing `deviceSessionId` for a device, use the `uuid` variable of `DeviceRiskManager`.

### Context Parameter

The `context` parameter helps Socure understand where, or under what circumstances, device data is collected. The available `context` enums are described below:

| Context       | Description                                                                                     | Example                                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `homepage`    | The main page that loads when the consumer opens an application.                                | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .homepage)`               |
| `signup`      | Pages related to creating an account.                                                           | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .signup)`                 |
| `login`       | Pages that serve as an entry or access point to an application, such as a login page.           | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .login)`                  |
| `profile`     | Pages on which account or profile updates are completed.                                        | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .profile)`                |
| `password`    | Pages related to password activities, such as resetting a password and creating a new password. | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .password)`               |
| `transaction` | Pages related to transactions, such as adding an item to a cart and completing a purchase.      | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .transaction)`            |
| `checkout`    | The page on which a consumer completes a purchase.                                              | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .checkout)`               |
| `other`       | Allows you to pass a custom value for pages on which the above context values do not apply.     | `DeviceRiskManager.sharedInstance.sendData(context: .other("custom context")` |


#### DataUploadCallback

`DataUploadCallback` is an optional protocol object required by `DeviceRiskManager` that receives the status of `sendData()`. It implements two main functions:

| Function                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dataUploadFinished(uploadResult: UploadResult)`               | The `dataUploadFinished()` function is returned when `sendData()` is successful. `UploadResult` is an object class that returns the device session `uuid` computed by our services. |
| `onError(errorType: SocureSDKErrorType, errorMessage: String)` | The `onError()` function is returned when `sendData()` encounters an error. We provide the error type via `errorType` and a message via `errorMessage`.                             |
